**********NOTE****************
This is not finished.  Try this at your own risk.  I warned you.
******************************

This install script is designed to help you get setup for local Accumulo development.  It is not intended for production installations.  The script will install the following into one directory, configure them for you and start them up:

Hadoop 0.20.2
Zookeeper 3-something
Accumulo 1.3.5

To run this script, simply execute the install-accumulo.sh script.  The -h option will give you more information about the possible options.  Typically, you can just fork the repo, cd to the directory and run

./install-accumulo.sh

If you want to install Accumulo without forking this repo, simply run the following:

bash <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/mjwall/accumulo-bash-installer/master/install-accumulo.sh)

Prerequistes
