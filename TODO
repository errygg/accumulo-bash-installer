- Figure out testing and then test everything
- Code zookeeper install
- Code accumulo install
- Update readme
- Test on linux
- Catch CTRL-C and run abort
- Update to hadoop 0.20.203?
- Look into Travis CI
- Add VERSION to install and output it to the log

From steve
- make prompts green
- ensure gpg is found
